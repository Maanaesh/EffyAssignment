# Company and User Management System

This is a full-stack web application that allows you to manage companies and users. The app is built using a RESTful API with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB on the backend. The frontend is built with React and Chakra UI for a modern user interface. It allows you to view, create, update, and manage companies and users, as well as plot company addresses on a map using coordinates.
